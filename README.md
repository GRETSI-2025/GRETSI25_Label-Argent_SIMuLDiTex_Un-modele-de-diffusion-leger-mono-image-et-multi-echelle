### Official pytorch implementation of the paper: "SIMuLDiTex: A Single Image Multiscale and Lightweight Diffusion Model for Texture Synthesis"

Examples of large scale synthesis, after training on the image displayed on the left:

Interpolation between 4 textures, synthesis of size 2048, downscaled by a factor 2, and compressed:

### Installation

These commands will create a conda environment called simulditex with the required dependencies, then place you in it :
```
conda env create -f requirements.yml
conda activate simulditex
```


### Pretrained models



###  Train

Training parameters are described in the train.py parser.

```
python train.py --name <name_of_the_experiment> 
```

### Inference

All experiments with hyperparameters are replicable in the notebook experiments.ipynb
